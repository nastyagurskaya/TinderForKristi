### This is for maximum customizability and / or learning purposes, not a pod or drop-in solution

The basics of a swipeable card interface inspired by Tinder and influenced by http://guti.in

This is meant to be taken and built off of, not as a simple drag and drop solution.  New developers are often forced to use dependencies they don't understand and can't customize.  This is the opposite.  I've fully explained exactly how this works in detailed comments so that you can take it apart and customize it at will.
